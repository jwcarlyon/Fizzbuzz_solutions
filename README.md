## gas_station
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N.
There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is A[i].<br>
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs B[i] of gas to travel from station i
to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.<br>
Return the minimum starting gas station’s index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.<br>
You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1, i+2, … n-1, 0, 1, 2.. <br>
Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.<br><br>
## sock_lord
This is a problem which supplies a list of integers and a single integer the
length of the list.
The list is an unsorted collection of numbers, with some possible double values.<br>
The function sockMerchant(<strong>int</strong> n, <strong>dynamic array</strong> ar)
must return the number of matching pairs in ar.
